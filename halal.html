                <p>When the love and passion for cooking is overflowing, there is no other way but to share and pass along.</p>
                <p>Chef Ahmad, a Syrian artist and entrepreneur based in the Philippines, considered himself as the lucky heir of his Mom’s cooking abilities. The same cooking which they take pride as an art and a legacy that passed on through time.</p><br>
                <img src="./images/halal2.jpeg" class="img2chefs pb-3" alt="Halal Kitchen">
                <p>Grew up in a commissary in Kuwait, Chef Ahmad invariably wakes up in the smell of his Mom’s cooking, that is how he burgeoned interests on food and beverage and on how his Mom magically sprinkles her cooking with a dash of love and passion.</p> 
                <p>His Mom, a half Syrian and half Greek, born and raised in Kuwait has always been the best cook in their family who repeatedly wins in cooking competitions for moms. She even specializes in cooking Biryani — the country’s well-known food. She adjusted and made her own touch to the recipe that became their neighborhood’s favorite version.</p>
                <img src="./images/halal3.jpeg" class="img2chefs pb-3" alt="Halal Kitchen">
                <p>Being fond of her cooking, the neighbors even asked Chef Ahmad’s mom to sell her food but accepting money was not really the arch on her list — it is making people feel loved and happy through her food.</p>
                <p>Even so, they believed that their mom’s creations must be illustriously popular so Chef Ahmad’s brother created an Instagram account to post and advertise their Mom’s food creations that is not just undeniably delicious but also appealing and appetizing in the eyes. This method gave them a way to sell their products without their Mom accepting cash payments.</p>
                <img src="./images/halal4.jpeg" class="img2chefs pb-3" alt="Halal Kitchen">
                <p>Throughout these years, Chef Ahmad’s mom has been the biggest and greatest influence he has on his food journey. His Mom’s love for cooking has been the best secret ingredient that really interests Chef Ahmad to the core. The same love that tastes like home. The same love and passion that he is pouring on to his food business today.</p>
